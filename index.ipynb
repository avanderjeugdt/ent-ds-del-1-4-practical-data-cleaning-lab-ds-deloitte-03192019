    "Now that you've been introduced to some of the basic approaches to cleaning up data, it's time for you to get some additional practice on your own. Remember, it's OK to look back at previous lessons and/or to use Google - professional programmers do both of those things all the time! And if you get stuck, feel free to ask a question - that's why we have an instructor in the classroom!\n",
